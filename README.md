## Problem
In this modern world people are very much connected with mobile. It has also been of great benefit in the time of Pandemic. But because of this people have stopped reading books today and people are getting away from reading and writing the stories.But even today, whenever people watch a movie or listen to any story, they make a story of their own in their mind. People think all this, but do not write to this anywhere and that story remains in their mind.

## Solution
Kalam is an app that gives people a chance to write their stories on the app. This app gives a good story for the story readers and gives good story writers a chance to write their own story. The idea of Kalam app is only to bring out a writer hidden inside the people.
